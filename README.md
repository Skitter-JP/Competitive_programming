# Commpetive Programming Solutions

Here I have posted all the programming problems I have solved in the following classes

- Programming for Engineers
- Algorithms

The homeworks in these classes followed a competivie programming style and they were absolutly great.

They were marked with by following

- Exceution Time
- Correct Output

One or two of the problems also were memory restricted.

We were allowed to choose which programming lanauge to solve them in. 

I chose Python in my case and still with such an easy lanauge some of these problems were very challanging to solve.

I do not own any of these problems just the solutions :)

Each folder will contain the following

- A brief of the problem in a .PDF file
- The solution of the problem in main.py
- Public data to test the code in pubdata.py
