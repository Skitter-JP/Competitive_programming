# Competitive Programming Solutions

In this repository, you will find programming problems that I solved in the following classes at the Czech Technical University:

- Programming for Engineers
- Algorithms

The homework assignments in these classes followed a competitive programming style and were fantastic. 

They were marked based on execution time, correct output, and memory restrictions (for one or two problems).

We were allowed to choose which programming language to use for the assignments. 
In my case, I chose Python, and even with such an easy language, some of these problems were very challenging to solve.

Each folder contains the following:

- A brief description of the problem in a .PDF file
- The solution to the problem in main.py
- Public data to test the code in pubdata.py

I do not own any of these problems, only the solutions.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, but please do not copy them directly for your own homework assignments.
